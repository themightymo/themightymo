# Hi, I'm Toby!

A community-builder at heart, I've helped get a handful of businesses, user groups, and conferences off the ground in Minneapolis. Between creating six free & open source WordPress plugins which are available on WordPress.org and two awesome musical performances, I'm also an active participant in local Arduino, Raspberry Pi, WordPress, and open-source tech communities.
